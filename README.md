## This is a macro made in python using the PynPut library.


** Don't use the mouse controls ** 
- They haven't been added yet
- I plan on adding them in the future

** Features ** 
- Can record all keyboard inputs
- Can record all mouse inputs and (x,y)
- Can play back all recorded inputs with a hotkey combination of the users choice

** Not-so-features ** 
- The mouse controls suck, do NOT use them at all
- Do not repeatedly spam the hotkey, it has a built in cool-down that may cause issues on the users end

** How to install **
- Download the main/dist directory
- Launch the .exe file
- Don't touch anything else
